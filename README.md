footswitch
==========

It's a Linux 'driver' program to use a [Brando USB Triple Foot Switch
II](http://usb.brando.com/usb-triple-foot-switch-ii_p01624c046d15.html) as a
MIDI controller for [Reaper](http://www.reaper.fm), via
[ReaStream](http://www.reaper.fm/reaplugs/).

That's awfully specific, but I guess it's decent example code for
* listening to the triple footswitch in exclusive mode on Linux
* sending MIDI events to ReaStream
so maybe one of these could be useful in some other context.
